# PyBer_Analysis
## Challenge Overview
The purpose of this assignment was to create a summary DataFrame and a multiple-line plot showing the sum of the fares for each city type.
## Resources
- Data Source: ride_data.csv; city_data.csv
- Software: Jupyter Notebook (anaconda python 3.7)

![Total Fare by City Type](https://github.com/Daniel-Schroeder15/PyBer_Analysis/blob/master/analysis/Total%20Fare%20by%20City%20Type.png)


The resources I used allowed me to create this table and graph displayed above. The DataFrame shows that the average fare per rider and average fare per driver for urban type cities are the least, but has the most revenue generated. The graph displays that depending on the time of year, the total fare by city fluctuates. All three city types say a spike upward towards the end of Feruary. The graph shows that each month can be volatile for urban, suburban, and rural cities. The average fare per driver and average fare per rider is highest with the rural cities.

The challenge I encountered during the dataframe was at the end of creating the dataframe. Once the table was created, I had to format the data correctly. Jupyter notebook was giving me  and issue with the formatting and data types. I went through my data set and realized fixed the problems with code, but error presisted. I restarted the jupyter notebook, and then the error was resolved. The graph was difficult to format. It was challenging to display exactly how I wanted it to look, but I did the best I could.

Based on the data from the different city types, I recommend running a marketing campaign in the urban cities. Urban cities is a clearly the money making machine for PyBer. I would also look into getting more drivers for urban and suburban cities. In order to capatalize on the cities, it would be best to gather data from the drivers that generated the most amount of revenue. We could see the number of hours they worked, what cities they work in, the number of rides they do, and what hours/days generate the most amount of fares. In order to analyze the drivers in more detail, we would need a lot more data. Time of year is also that affects the total fares. If we could gather data for a full year, I could create a graph from January to December that may display any trends. This could also create a graph for each month.
